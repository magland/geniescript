# Python Code Generation Requirements

The generated Python code should follow these guidelines:

1. Use type hints for function parameters and return values
2. Include docstrings for functions following Google style
3. Handle errors gracefully with appropriate error messages
4. Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
5. Include comments explaining complex logic
6. Use meaningful variable names
7. Be efficient in terms of memory usage
8. Include example usage in docstrings

The code should be production-ready and maintainable, demonstrating Python best practices.
